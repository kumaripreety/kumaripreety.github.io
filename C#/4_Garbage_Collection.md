| S.NO | C                                                            | C#                                                           |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1.  | C language supports procedural programming.                  | Whereas C# supports object oriented programming.             |
|  2.  | C language supports pointers.                                | Whereas in C#, pointers are used only in unsafe mode.        |
|  3.  | In C language, garbage collection is not.                    | While in C#, garbage collection is managed by **[Common Language Runtime (CLR)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/common-language-runtime-clr-in-c-sharp/)**. |
|  4.  | C language can be executed cross-platform.                   | Whereas [.NET Framework](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-net-framework/) is required to execute C# language. |
|  5.  | By using C language we can achieve low level of abstraction. | Whereas by using the C# we can achieve a high degree of abstraction. |
|  6.  | C language is more on functions.                             | While C# is more on design.                                  |
|  7.  | C language gives top notch performance.                      | While C# gives standard performance.                         |
|  8.  | There are 32 total keywords used in the C language.          | While a total of 86 keywords are used in C#.                 |
|  9.  | C language is mainly used in commercial industries and engineering. | Whereas C# is used for software formation and other networking related objective. |







| FEATURE                     | C#                                                           | JAVA                                                         |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operator Overloading**    | C# supports operator overloading for multiple operators.     | Java does not support operator overloading.                  |
| **Runtime Environment**     | C# supports [CLR](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/common-language-runtime-clr-in-c/)(Common Language Runtime). | Java supports [JVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/)(Java Virtual Machine). |
| **API Control**             | C# API are completely controlled by Microsoft.               | Java API are controlled by open community process.           |
| **Public Classes**          | In C#, there can be many public classes inside a source code. | In Java there can be only one public class inside a source code otherwise there will be compilation error. |
| **Checked Exceptions**      | C# does not supports for checked exception. In some cases checked exceptions are very useful for smooth execution of program. | Java supports both checked and unchecked exceptions.         |
| **Platform Dependency**     | C# code is windows specific. Although Microsoft is working to make it global but till now the major system does not provide support for C#. | Java is a robust and platform independent language. Platform independency of Java is through JVM. |
| **Pointers**                | In C# pointers can be used only in unsafe mode.              | Java does not supports anyway use of pointers.               |
| **Conditional Compilation** | C# supports for conditional compilation.                     | Java does not supports for conditional compilation.          |
| **goto statement**          | C# supports for goto statement.                              | Java does not supports for goto statement. Use of goto statement will cause error in Java code. |
| **Structure and Union**     | C# supports structures and unions.                           | Java doesnâ€™t support structures and unions.                  |
| **Floating Point**          | C# does not supports strictfp keyword that means it result of floating point numbers may not be guaranteed to be same across all platforms. | Java supports [strictfp keyword](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strictfp-keyword-java/) that means its result for floating point numbers will be same for various platform. |







| S.NO | C#                                                           | PYTHON                                                       |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1.  | C# is developed by Microsoft and comes with the license.     | Whereas python is a open-source platform and available free of cost, even for commercial purpose. |
|  2.  | C# supports object oriented programming only.                | While python supports multi-paradigm programming language such as OOPs and structured programming and many others. |
|  3.  | C# requires .NET Framework.                                  | While it can also be integrated with .NET, C, JavaScript and java. |
|  4.  | C# does not support any interpreter.                         | While python supports interactive interpreter for writing programs. |
|  5.  | C# multi-threading is quite easy due to the use of .NET Framework. | While in python, multi-threading needs many process due to **Global interpreter lock**. |
|  6.  | There are 86 total keywords used in the C#.                  | While a total of 33 keywords are used in python 3.7 .        |
|  7.  | In C#, pointers are used only in unsafe mode.                | Here, Python does not support pointers.                      |
|  8.  | C# is a static-type language.                                | While python language is a dynamic-type language.            |
|  9.  | In C#, variable type must be declared before use.            | While in python there is no need to declare variable type before use. |
| 10.  | C# program files are saved by **.cs extension**.             | Whereas python program files are saved by **.py extension**. |
| 11.  | C# is tough to learn in comparison with python.              | While python is easy to learn.                               |
